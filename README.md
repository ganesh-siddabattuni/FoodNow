## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

FoodNow is built using a decoupled, client-server architecture.

* **Backend**: A stateless, JWT-secured REST API built with Spring Boot. It follows a layered architecture (Controller ‚ûî Service ‚ûî Repository) to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
* **Frontend**: A dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Angular. It uses a service-based architecture with centralized state management to create a reactive and efficient user experience.
